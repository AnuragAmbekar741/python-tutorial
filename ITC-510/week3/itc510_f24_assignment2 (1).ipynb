Do **not** use exception handling (**try/except**) statements.  Do **not** use AI (chatGPT, Copilot, etc.) to write your functions.\n","\n","**Make sure to add a Markdown cell after your code cell for each problem that explains your test cases and results**.\n","\n","This assignment can be done individually or as a group of up to **three students**. Only one student should turn in the assignment but all students in a group should at least submit a comment indicating who was in their group and specifying who is responsible for turning in the assignment.
